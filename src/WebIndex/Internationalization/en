setting.seed.description=The seed table contains a curated list of starting URLs that serve as the entry point for the crawling process. Each of these initial web pages functions as a so-called seed source from which additional pages can be automatically discovered and indexed. This targeted starting base ensures that the crawler can systematically and thematically capture relevant websites.

setting.catalog.description=The catalog provides a structured overview of all web pages captured during the crawling process.

The collected information forms the central data foundation for the reverse index and enables efficient and targeted search queries within the system.
